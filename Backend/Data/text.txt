Here comes the bowler... short delivery — and it’s pulled away beautifully toward deep square leg! That’s four runs — pure timing from the batter!.
Two runs needed from one ball. The crowd is on its feet! Can he do it? The bowler runs in… and he’s bowled him! What a finish! Unbelievable scenes here.
The sun is setting over the stadium, the atmosphere is electric, and the pressure is mounting on the fielding side. Every run matters now.
